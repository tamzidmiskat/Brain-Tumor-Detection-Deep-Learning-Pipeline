# Brain Tumor Detection: Deep Learning Pipeline

This project implements a comprehensive deep learning pipeline for detecting brain tumors using MRI images. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning (VGG16) to classify images into "tumor" or "no tumor" categories.

## Project Overview
The notebook demonstrates:
- Preprocessing and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Building and training a CNN model with transfer learning using VGG16.
- Evaluating the model and visualizing results.

## Features
- **Dataset Splitting**: Automatically divides the dataset into train, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Architecture**: Leverages VGG16 for transfer learning, adding custom layers for classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance visualizations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Add the dataset to the `dataset/` directory. Ensure it is organized into `yes` and `no` folders.
2. Open `Brain_Tumor_Detection_v1_0____CNN,_VGG_16.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
3. Execute the cells to:
   - Preprocess and split the dataset.
   - Train the model using VGG16.
   - Evaluate the model and visualize results.

4. Access the evaluation metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrix, to assess performance.
